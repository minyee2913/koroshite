# Samurai 

This mod adds a custom survivor to Risk of Rain Returns; the Samurai. 

Slice enemies with his blade, throw shurikens that make them bleed, and parry predictable attacks,
but don't forget to take a break and enjoy a pleasant drink every now and then!

## Skills

### Primary - Oma Kugiuchi

Samurai's primary ability is a straight forward melee combo, dealing 150% damage with each hit.


### Secondary - Shuriken

Samurai throws a shuriken that deals 60% damage on impact, and then bleeds the enemy for 4x35%
total damage. Throws more as he gets more drunk.


### Utility - Flash

Samurai briefly enters a defensive stance and becomes invulnerable. If an enemy hits him during
this he will counter with a swift slashing attack that deals 70% damage and resets his Shuriken 
and Sip cooldowns, allowing you to build up drunk stacks. The counter attack gets more slashes as 
he gets more drunk.


### Alternate Utility - Instant Flash

Much the same as Flash, but with a tighter parry window and 120% damage counterattack instead of
just 70%. Very risky, but the reward can be worth it.


### Special - Sip

Samurai spends a moment sipping his sake, gaining a stack of drunkenness that lasts 20 seconds.
The cooldown is 30 seconds, so you'll need to reduce or reset it (usually by using Flash) to build 
more stacks.


## Multiplayer

Multiplayer hopefully works, but it's hard to test and so it might not. Please give it a go and let
me know if you run into any issues.
