### V1.1.0
 
Added some colours, made major balance changes, and fixed a bug.

The risk/reward skew of parry was too crazy, so I've toned down how powerful the followup attack
is. In exchange the parry window is much longer, making it much easier to get stacks. Since stacks
are easier to get, I've reduced the buff duration from 30 to 20 seconds too. Finally, I've added
an alternate parry that retains the tight timing for higher damage - although it still doesn't 
restore the damage reflection from before as that was simply too powerful.

- Rebalance parry window from 20 to 40 frames
- Increase parry cooldown by 1 second
- Rebalance counter-attack damage from 7% reflected damage to 70% regular damage
- Remove heal effect from Sip, as it's much easier to reset its cooldown now
- Reduce drunk buff duration from 30 seconds to 20 seconds (still 30 seconds with scepter)
- Add an alternate parry with a 20 frame parry window and 120% damage per hit
- Fix shurikens knocking enemies in the wrong direction
